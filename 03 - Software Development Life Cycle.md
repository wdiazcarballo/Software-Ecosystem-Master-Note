### Class plan

**Objective**: Provide students with hands-on experience in applying the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) based on ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 standards, Kanban principles for project management, and the use of GitHub for managing an open-source software ecosystem. The activities will focus on enhancing their software products related to Lampang's local ceramic sales.

**Duration**: 3 hours

---

#### **Pre-Class Preparation: Self-Paced Learning**
- **Content**:
  - **SDLC and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 Standards**: Students will be assigned an online course on platforms like Coursera or edX that covers SDLC fundamentals and the ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 standards. A recommended course is “Software Processes and Agile Practices” by University of Alberta on Coursera.
  - **Kanban Principles for Software Project Management**: Students will complete a short online tutorial on Kanban, such as "Kanban Fundamentals" on LinkedIn Learning.
  - **Using GitHub for Software Development**: Students will go through GitHub’s official "Hello World" guide and watch GitHub’s "Mastering GitHub" series on YouTube.

### **In-Class Practical Hands-On Activities**

#### **Part 1: Mapping SDLC to the Ceramic Product Idea**
- **Time**: 30 minutes
- **Activity**:
  - **Ceramic Product Storyboarding**: Each group creates a storyboard that maps out the development phases of their software product, emphasizing how it adds value to Lampang’s ceramic products.
  - **Group Discussion**: Groups present their storyboards, receiving feedback on aligning their SDLC phases with the ceramic product idea.

#### **Part 2: Fun with Kanban and Ceramics**
- **Time**: 45 minutes
- **Activity**:
  - **Ceramic Design Sprint**: Students participate in a rapid design sprint where they brainstorm new features or digital enhancements for the ceramic products, such as AR-based design tools or online custom orders. They then update their Kanban boards to include these new tasks.
  - **Gamification**: Introduce a points system where teams earn points for completing tasks on their Kanban boards related to the ceramic project. The team with the most points at the end of the session wins a small prize (e.g., ceramic-themed merchandise).

#### **Part 3: GitHub Collaborative Coding Challenge**
- **Time**: 60 minutes
- **Activity**:
  - **Ceramic Product Feature Branch**: Each team creates a new branch in their GitHub repository to develop a specific feature related to their ceramic product idea (e.g., a virtual showroom or customer feedback system).
  - **Merge Conflicts Simulation**: Teams intentionally create and resolve merge conflicts in their repositories, simulating real-world collaborative coding challenges.
  - **Open Source Contribution**: Students search for an open-source project on GitHub that could benefit their ceramic product. They create a pull request or open an issue, contributing to the community while integrating valuable code into their project.

#### **Part 4: Ceramic-Themed Open-Source Ecosystem Exploration**
- **Time**: 30 minutes
- **Activity**:
  - **Ceramic Marketplace Simulation**: Students explore existing open-source projects that could be used to create an online marketplace for Lampang ceramics. They brainstorm how to integrate these projects into their software product.
  - **Ecosystem Integration**: Teams work on incorporating at least one open-source component into their project, with the goal of enhancing functionality related to ceramic sales or production.

**Closing and Q&A**
- **Time**: 15 minutes
- Recap of the day’s activities and key learnings.
- Open floor for questions and feedback.
- Homework: Teams will submit a progress report that includes updates on their GitHub repository, Kanban board, and the integration of open-source components by the next session.
